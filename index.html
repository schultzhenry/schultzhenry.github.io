            <p>
              In partial fulfillment of Yale's Graphic Design Methodologies
              course with Pamela Hovland, I designed this zine to celebrate
              the historic representation of women in the 116th Congress.
              <br /><br />
              The body of the zine lists all congressional representatives
              from the 1st Congress, which began meeting in 1789, to the 116th Congress, elected
              in 2018. Names of women are printed in green.
              <br /><br />
              10 copies of the zine were printed for the

              <h3>Engender</h3><h4>2016-now</h4>
            </div>
            <p>In 2016, events involving race and gender-based discrimination
              motivated a group of classmates and I to correct structural inequalities on our campus.
              To organize around this goal, we founded Engender.
              <br /><br />
              Currently, Engender advocates for reforming Greek organizations given their
              discriminatory nature and disproportionate control over undergraduate social life.
              The existing structure of these organizations enables harmful behaviors
              including hazing, substance abuse, sexual misconduct, and acts of hate that occur frequently
              on American college campuses to the detriment of students' mental and physical wellbeing.
              Our organization advocates for better oversight of these organizations as well as membership
              policies designed to celebrate rather than punish difference.
              <br /><br />
              My personal responsibilities for Engender have included communications, identity, branding,
              member onboarding, and organizing a group of women and nonbinary students to rush a fraternity.

              Evan Duby, a broker with Compass, specializes in townhouse and apartment
              sales throughout brownstone Brooklyn. While I took gap year from college,
              Evan hired me to design print and online marketing materials in addition
              to managing client relations and marketing strategy for his agent team
              based in Park Slope. See Evan's page on
              <a href="https://www.compass.com/agents/nyc/evan-duby/">Compass</a>.
              <br /><br />
              Upon return to school, I continued to design for the team remotely until
              beginning a new position on campus.

            <h3>Fuzzy Grids II</h3><h4>2014</h4>
            <p>
              While interning at Predock_Frane architects, I helped design and fabricate Fuzzy Grids II,
              an interactive art installation at the Getty Center.
              <br /><br />
              <i> Fuzzy Grids II is a field of colorful large-scale cubes set on the grid of the Getty Center's
              Arrival Plaza. The white boxes reference the monochrome surfaces of Richard Meier's architecture,
              while the color is sampled from the polychromatic Robert Irwin-designed garden.
              In collaboration with sound artist Chris Rountree, who supplies an idiosyncratic soundtrack to
              guide participants with different tempos and atmospheres, Predock_Frane Architects have designed
              a flexible kit of parts that visitors can manipulate—like a giant game board—to form patterns,
              images, and even three-dimensional landscapes.</i><br /><br />
